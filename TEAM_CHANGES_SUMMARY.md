## 📁 Modified Files

### 1. **`import_mrv_data.py`** (+136 lines)
**What changed**: Added intelligent scoring algorithm to calculate Econowind fit scores

**Scoring Criteria** (0-8 points total):

#### Ship Type (0-2 points)
- ✅ **+2 points** for preferred types:
  - Bulk carriers
  - General cargo
  - Chemical tankers
  - LNG carriers
  - Ro-Ro cargo ships
  - Other ship types

#### Vessel Length (0-2 points)
- ✅ **+2 points**: 100-160m (optimal size)
- ✅ **+1 point**: 80-100m or 160-200m (acceptable)
- ❌ **0 points**: Outside these ranges

#### CO₂ Emissions Intensity (0-2 points)
- ✅ **+2 points**: Top 25% emitters (≥75th percentile)
- ✅ **+1 point**: Above median (≥50th percentile)
- ❌ **0 points**: Below median (already efficient)

#### Technical Efficiency (0-2 points)
- ✅ **+2 points**: Efficiency rating > 10 gCO₂/t·nm
- ✅ **+1 point**: Efficiency rating 6-10 gCO₂/t·nm
- ❌ **0 points**: < 6 gCO₂/t·nm

**Logic**: Higher scores = better candidates for wind propulsion retrofits
- High emitters have more to gain
- Optimal size vessels are mechanically suitable
- Preferred ship types have compatible operations

### 2. **`web_tracker.py`** (+21 lines)
**What changed**: 
- Added `ensure_econowind_column()` function for database migration
- Updated all emissions API endpoints to include `econowind_fit_score`
- Ensures backward compatibility with existing databases

**Modified API Endpoints**:
- `/api/emissions/vessel/<imo>` - Now includes fit score
- `/api/emissions/top` - Includes fit score in results
- `/api/emissions/company/<name>` - Shows fit scores for fleet
- `/api/vessels/combined` - Includes fit score in combined data

### 3. **`templates/database_enhanced.html`** (+55 lines)
**What changed**: Added visual Econowind fit score column with color-coded badges

**UI Enhancements**:
- New sortable column: "Econowind Fit"
- Color-coded badges:
  - 🟢 **Green (High)**: Score ≥ 5 (excellent candidates)
  - 🟡 **Yellow (Medium)**: Score 3-4 (good candidates)
  - 🔴 **Red (Low)**: Score < 3 (poor candidates)
  - ⚫ **Gray (N/A)**: No score available

**Visual Design**:
```css
.score-badge.high { background: #51cf66; }    /* Green */
.score-badge.medium { background: #ffd43b; }  /* Yellow */
.score-badge.low { background: #ff6b6b; }     /* Red */
.score-badge.na { background: #495057; }      /* Gray */
```

## 🎯 Business Value

### For Econowind:
This feature enables **automated lead generation** for wind propulsion retrofits:

1. **Identify High-Value Targets**
   - Vessels with high emissions (most savings potential)
   - Optimal size for wind propulsion systems
   - Compatible ship types and operations

2. **Prioritize Sales Efforts**
   - Sort by fit score to find best prospects
   - Filter by score threshold (e.g., score ≥ 5)
   - Export candidate lists for sales team

3. **Data-Driven Approach**
   - Objective scoring based on emissions data
   - Combines multiple criteria automatically
   - Updates as new vessels are discovered

### Example Use Cases:
```sql
-- Find top 50 Econowind candidates
SELECT * FROM eu_mrv_emissions 
WHERE econowind_fit_score >= 5 
ORDER BY econowind_fit_score DESC, total_co2_emissions DESC 
LIMIT 50;

-- Find high-scoring bulk carriers
SELECT * FROM eu_mrv_emissions 
WHERE ship_type = 'Bulk carrier' 
  AND econowind_fit_score >= 4
ORDER BY econowind_fit_score DESC;

-- Companies with most high-fit vessels
SELECT company_name, COUNT(*) as high_fit_vessels
FROM eu_mrv_emissions
WHERE econowind_fit_score >= 5
GROUP BY company_name
ORDER BY high_fit_vessels DESC;
```

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Database:
- ✅ New column added to `eu_mrv_emissions` table
- ✅ Scores calculated for all 13,964 vessels
- ✅ Automatic migration for existing databases

### API:
- ✅ All emissions endpoints now return fit scores
- ✅ Can filter/sort by fit score
- ✅ Backward compatible (graceful degradation)

### UI:
- ✅ Visual identification of good candidates
- ✅ Sortable fit score column
- ✅ Color-coded for quick scanning
- ✅ Integrated with existing emissions data

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Apply These Changes on VPS:

```bash
# 1. Already pulled locally (done above)

# 2. SSH to VPS and pull
ssh erik@149.202.53.2
cd /var/www/apihub
git pull origin master

# 3. Re-import MRV data to calculate scores
source venv/bin/activate
python import_mrv_data.py
deactivate

# 4. Restart web tracker
sudo systemctl restart ais-web-tracker

# 5. Verify
curl http://localhost:5000/ships/api/emissions/top?limit=10 | jq '.[] | {name: .vessel_name, score: .econowind_fit_score}'
```

### To Test Locally:

```bash
# Re-import MRV data with scoring
python import_mrv_data.py

# Start web tracker
python web_tracker.py

# Visit enhanced database
http://localhost:5000/ships/database
```

## 🎉 Summary

Your team added a **smart lead generation system** that:
- ✅ Automatically scores 13,964 vessels for Econowind fit
- ✅ Combines 4 criteria: ship type, size, emissions, efficiency
- ✅ Visualizes scores in the UI with color-coded badges
- ✅ Exposes scores via API for external tools
- ✅ Enables data-driven sales targeting

**This transforms your vessel tracker into a sales intelligence platform!** 🌊⛵📊

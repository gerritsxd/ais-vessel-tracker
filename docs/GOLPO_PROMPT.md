**Video Topic**: AI-Powered Company Intelligence Scraper for Predicting Wind Propulsion Adoption

**Perspective**: Technical explanation for business/tech audience

**Instructions**:

Create a 1-minute animated explainer video about an AI-powered scraping system that researches shipping companies to predict wind propulsion technology adoption.

**Video Structure**:

[0:00-0:10] HOOK - Show the problem: Split screen with shipping companies list on left, scattered news articles on right. Text overlay: "How to predict which companies will adopt wind propulsion?"

[0:10-0:25] SOLUTION - Animated flow diagram: Database of companies → AI brain (Gemini logo) → Web search icon → Structured JSON output. Text: "AI-Powered Research System"

[0:25-0:40] THE 5 CATEGORIES - Show 5 animated cards appearing one by one:
1. 💰 Grants & Subsidies (green money icon) - "Government funding, EU grants"
2. ⚖️ Legal Violations (scales icon) - "Lawsuits, fines, regulatory issues"
3. 🌱 Sustainability News (leaf icon) - "Green tech, wind propulsion projects"
4. 🏆 Reputation (trophy icon) - "Industry ratings, sustainability scores"
5. 💸 Financial Pressure (chart icon) - "Carbon tax exposure, EU ETS costs"

[0:40-0:55] HOW IT WORKS - Animated pipeline flow:
Company Name → Gemini AI Research → Web Search Results → Structured JSON → ML Predictions

[0:55-1:00] RESULT - Dashboard mockup showing company list with WASP adoption probability bars and confidence scores.

**Visual Style**: Modern tech aesthetic, blue and green color scheme, smooth animations, icons with subtle motion, data flow arrows.

**Tone**: Energetic, tech-forward, professional but accessible.

**Key Statistics to Highlight**:
- 5 categories of intelligence
- 1,500 free requests/day (Gemini free tier)
- Fully automated
- Feeds ML models for predictions

## Video Title
**"AI-Powered Company Intelligence Scraper: Predicting Wind Propulsion Adoption"**

---

## Script (60 seconds)

### [0:00-0:10] HOOK - The Problem
**Visual**: Split screen showing shipping companies vs. scattered news articles

**Narration:**
> "How do you predict which shipping companies will adopt wind propulsion technology? We built an AI-powered scraper that researches companies across the entire internet - not just their websites."

---

### [0:10-0:25] THE SOLUTION - What We Built
**Visual**: Animation showing:
- Database of shipping companies → AI research → Structured intelligence data
- Google Gemini AI logo → Web search → JSON output

**Narration:**
> "Our system uses Google Gemini AI to automatically research each company. It searches news sites, government databases, legal records, and industry publications. The AI extracts structured intelligence in 5 key categories."

---

### [0:25-0:40] THE 5 CATEGORIES - What We Collect
**Visual**: 5 cards appearing one by one with icons:

1. **💰 Grants & Subsidies** - Government funding, EU grants
2. **⚖️ Legal Violations** - Lawsuits, fines, regulatory issues  
3. **🌱 Sustainability News** - Green tech, wind propulsion projects
4. **🏆 Reputation** - Industry ratings, sustainability scores
5. **💸 Financial Pressure** - Carbon tax exposure, EU ETS costs

**Narration:**
> "We collect: Grants and subsidies - companies with government funding have budget for green tech. Legal violations - companies needing reputation facelifts. Sustainability news - actual green initiatives. Reputation rankings - industry performance scores. And financial pressure - carbon tax exposure."

---

### [0:40-0:55] HOW IT WORKS - The Process
**Visual**: Flow diagram:
1. Company name from database
2. AI sends research prompt to Gemini
3. Gemini searches web and returns JSON
4. Data saved to structured files
5. Used for ML predictions

**Narration:**
> "For each company, we send a structured prompt to Gemini AI. It searches the web, finds relevant articles, and returns JSON with titles, snippets, URLs, and dates. This data feeds our machine learning models that predict WASP adoption probability."

---

### [0:55-1:00] THE RESULT - Why It Matters
**Visual**: Dashboard showing predictions with confidence scores

**Narration:**
> "The result? We can predict which companies are most likely to adopt wind propulsion - helping identify the best sales targets. All automated, all free, using AI."
